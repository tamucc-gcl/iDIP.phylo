## Example with `IDIP()`

This is taken directly from [Gaggiotti et al. 2018 Supp 1](eva12593-sup-0001-supinfo.pdf)

```r
# Example IDIP data matrix
# cols are samples
# rows are either species or asv or or zotu or otu or alleles or ...
# values are counts
Data = 
  cbind( 
    c(1,0,7,0,2,0),
    c(16,0,12,5,1,1),
    c(2,0,11,14,0,3),
    c(10,5,1,1,11,2),
    c(15,14,0,21,10,0)
  )
Data
```

```r

[5,]    2    1    0   11   10
[6,]    0    1    3    2    0
```

```r
# Example IDIP structural hierarchy matrix
# cols are samples
# rows are hierarchical categorizations of the samples
# values are the name of each category

Struc = 
  rbind(
    rep("Ecosystem",5),
    c(rep("Region1",2),rep("Region2",3)),
    paste0("Sample",1:5)
  )
Struc
```

```r

[3,] "Sample1"   "Sample2"   "Sample3"   "Sample4"   "Sample5"  
```

D_alpha.1         3.5401962
D_beta.2          1.1267539

Proportion.1      0.7003236
Differentiation.2 0.2036698

```

* **D_gamma** = 5.272 is interpreted as that the effective number of alleles in the
ecosystem (total diversity) is 5.272.
* **D_alpha.2** = 4.679 is interpreted as that each region contains 4.679 allele
equivalents;
* **D-beta.2** = 1.127 implies that there are 1.13 region equivalents. Thus, 4.679 x
1.127 = 5.272 (=D_gamma).
* **D_alpha.1** = 3.540 is interpreted as that each sample within a region contains
3.540 allele equivalents;
* **D_beta.1** =1.322 is interpreted as that there are 1.32 sample equivalents per
region. Here 1.322 x 3.540 = 4.679 species per region (= D_alpha.2).
* **Proportion.2** = 0.30 means that the proportion of total beta information found at
the regional level is 30%.
* **Proportion.1** = 0.70 means that the proportion of total beta information found at
the sample level is 70%.
* **Differentiation.2** =0.204 implies that the mean differentiation/dissimilarity among
regions is 0.204. This can be interpreted as the following effective sense: the mean
proportion of non-shared alleles in a region is around 20.4%.
* **Differentiation.1** = 0.310 implies that the mean differentiation/dissimilarity among samples within a region is 0.31, i.e., the mean proportion of non-shared alleles in a sample is around 31.0%.

```

* The total branch length (Faithâ€™s PD) in the phylogenetic tree is 321.525.
* The weighted (by species abundance) mean of the distances from root node to each of the tips is 94.169.
* PD_gamma = 274.388 is interpreted as that the effective total branch length in the ecosystem (total phylogenetic diversity) is 274.388.
* PD_alpha.2 = 255.194 is interpreted as that the effective total branch length per region is 255.194.
* PD-beta.2 = 1.075 means that there are 1.08 region equivalents. Thus, 255.194 x 1.075 = 274.388 (=PD_gamma).
* PD_alpha.1 =223.231 is interpreted as that the effective total branch length per
sample within each region is 223.231.
* PD_beta.1 =1.143 implies that there are 1.14 sample equivalents per region. Here 223.231 x 1.143 = 255.194 (= PD_alpha.2).
* PD_prop.2 = 0.351 means that the proportion of total phylogenetic beta information found in the regional level is 35.1%.
* PD_prop.1 = 0.649 means that the proportion of total phylogenetic beta information found in the sample level is 64.9%.
* PD_diff.2 = 0.124 implies that the mean phylogenetic differentiation among regions is 0.124. This can be interpreted as the following effective sense: the mean proportion of non-shared lineages in a region is around 12.5%.
* PD_diff.1 =0.149 implies that the mean phylogenetic differentiation among samples within a region is 0.149, i.e., the mean proportion of non-shared lineages in a sample is around 14.9%.

## Creating matrix for `struct` argument

You need a matrix that follows the instructions in supplement 1, here's an example with a lot of levels

```r
> # Level 1: Regions (first 10 samples are Region1, next 10 are Region2)
> Region <- c(rep("Region1", 10), rep("Region2", 10))
> # Level 2: Archipelagos 
> # Region1: Arch1 for first 5 samples, Arch2 for next 5; Region2: Arch3 for first 5 samples, Arch4 for next 5.
> Archipelago <- c(rep("Arch1", 5), rep("Arch2", 5), rep("Arch3", 5), rep("Arch4", 5))
> # Level 3: Island Groups 
> # In each Archipelago, assign 2 groups: the first group gets 3 samples, the second gets 2.
> IslandGroup <- c(rep("IG1_1", 3), rep("IG1_2", 2),    # Region1, Arch1
+                  rep("IG2_1", 3), rep("IG2_2", 2),    # Region1, Arch2
+                  rep("IG3_1", 3), rep("IG3_2", 2),    # Region2, Arch3
+                  rep("IG4_1", 3), rep("IG4_2", 2))    # Region2, Arch4
> # Level 4: Islands
> # Each Island Group corresponds to exactly one Island (names match the group, but with an "I_" prefix).
> Island <- c(rep("I_1_1_1", 3), rep("I_1_1_2", 2),   # For IG1_1 and IG1_2 (Region1, Arch1)
+             rep("I_1_2_1", 3), rep("I_1_2_2", 2),   # For IG2_1 and IG2_2 (Region1, Arch2)
+             rep("I_2_1_1", 3), rep("I_2_1_2", 2),   # For IG3_1 and IG3_2 (Region2, Arch3)
+             rep("I_2_2_1", 3), rep("I_2_2_2", 2))   # For IG4_1 and IG4_2 (Region2, Arch4)
> # Level 5: Locations
> # To avoid having the same location name in two different islands, we incorporate the island name.
> # For islands with 3 samples, use _Loc1, _Loc2, _Loc3; for islands with 2 samples, use _Loc1 and _Loc2.
> Location <- c(
+   paste0("I_1_1_1_Loc", 1:3),    # 3 samples for I_1_1_1
+   paste0("I_1_1_2_Loc", 1:2),      # 2 samples for I_1_1_2
+   paste0("I_1_2_1_Loc", 1:3),      # 3 samples for I_1_2_1
+   paste0("I_1_2_2_Loc", 1:2),      # 2 samples for I_1_2_2
+   paste0("I_2_1_1_Loc", 1:3),      # 3 samples for I_2_1_1
+   paste0("I_2_1_2_Loc", 1:2),      # 2 samples for I_2_1_2
+   paste0("I_2_2_1_Loc", 1:3),      # 3 samples for I_2_2_1
+   paste0("I_2_2_2_Loc", 1:2)       # 2 samples for I_2_2_2
+ )
> # Level 6: Sample identifiers (each unique)
> Sample <- paste0("S", 1:20)
> # Combine all levels into a matrix where each column represents one sample
> Struc <- rbind(Region, Archipelago, IslandGroup, Island, Location, Sample)
